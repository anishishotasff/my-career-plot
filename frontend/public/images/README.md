# Profile Images

## How to Add Profile Pictures

1. Save your profile photos in this directory
2. Recommended format: JPG or PNG
3. Recommended size: 400x400px (square)
4. File names:
   - `anish.jpg` - Founder photo

## Current Setup

The Blog page is configured to display:
- **Anish Debnath**: `/images/anish.jpg`
- **Pilat Debbarma**: `/images/pilat.jpg`

If images are not found, it will fallback to emoji (👨‍💻).

## Steps to Add the Dog Photo for Co-Founder:

1. Save the dog photo you shared as `pilat.jpg` in this directory
2. The image will automatically appear on the Blog page
